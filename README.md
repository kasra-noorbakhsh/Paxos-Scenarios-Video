# ðŸŽ¥ Paxos Scenarios Visualization Videos

This repository contains three educational videos created using the Manim animation library (developed by 3Blue1Brown) to illustrate and explain different scenarios of the Paxos consensus algorithm from the Distributed Systems course.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Video 1**: Demonstrates the basic Paxos scenario with proposers, acceptors, and learners achieving consensus without failures.
- **Video 2**: Explores a failure scenario in Paxos, such as a crashed proposer, and how the algorithm recovers to reach agreement.
- **Video 3**: Covers an advanced Paxos scenario involving multiple rounds and conflicting proposals, showing the role of ballot numbers in resolving conflicts.
